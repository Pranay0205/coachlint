CoachLint is your AI coding coach. It guides you through errors instead of ***just solving them for you.***

## My Motivation

Developers are becoming increasingly dependent on quick code fixes and instant code generation. When we use external AI tools, there's no middle ground - the AI just gives you the answer. People copy-paste solutions without understanding the **why** behind them.

This approach makes us lose the core skill that makes a software engineer valuable: **understanding the problem and solving it systematically**.

**AI is best for breaking down complex errors into very easy and understandable explanations.** I believe CoachLint will help developers learn more deeply instead of developing shallow programming skills.

## Features

- **Error Explanations** - Hover over errors for plain English explanations
- **Code Quality Review** - Get improvement suggestions for your Python code
- **Educational Focus** - Learn concepts, not just quick fixes
